# Approximate Rank Order Clustering
PAPER:PAMI2017:Clustering Millions of Faces by Identity

This repository contains an implementation of [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00989.pdf) paper.
## What's in this repository
[clustering.py](https://github.com/varun-suresh/Clustering/blob/master/clustering.py) - Contains the implementaion of the clustering algorithm.

[demo.py](https://github.com/varun-suresh/Clustering/blob/master/demo.py) - An example to demonstrate usage. To run this, you need to download the LFW data from [here](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/). For the face vectors, I used the results from Alfred Xiang Wu's [Face Verification Experiment](https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/face_verification_experiment/tree/master/results). Also evaluates clustering on the LFW dataset using `evaluation.py`.

[evaluation.py](https://github.com/varun-suresh/Clustering/blob/master/demo.py) - Script to calculate pairwise precision and recall as explained in the paper.
TODO

[server.py](https:github.com/varun-suresh/Clustering) - Script to visualize the results.

## Setup
You will need `cmake` for this installation.

### Step 1:
Create a new virtual environment and clone the repository.
```
mkvirtualenv (env-name)
workon (env-name)
git clone https:github.com/varun-suresh/Clustering.git
```

### Step 2:
Follow the instructions [here](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/) to install `pyflann`.

### Step 3:
For the demo, download the LFW data and the face vectors as mentioned above and run

```
cd Clustering
python demo.py --lfw_path path_to_lfw_dir -v vector_file
```

## Results

## Visualization

There is a very basic visualization script in place to examine the clusters. To
use the script, download the LFW images and store them in `yourpath/Clustering/` directory.

Before you can run the visualization script, you must run the demo script to save the clusters. I have also uploaded the [clusters](http://github.com/) file. You can download that and visualize the clusters as well.

```
python visualize.py --lfw_path lfw/
```
On your browser, open [this link](http://localhost:5000/clusters) and you should see the clusters.

### f1 score:
We get a f1 score of 0.88 ~ 0.9 on the LFW dataset. 

### Contributions
Thanks [Mengyue](https://github.com/gmy001) for looking closely at the precision drop and correcting the error.

### Timing:
Using python's multiprocessing module, clustering LFW faces took about ~40 seconds. I did this on an 8-core machine using 4 processes(Using all 8 does not improve it by much because some cores are needed for background processes). The same experiment took 7 seconds on a 20 core machine.
